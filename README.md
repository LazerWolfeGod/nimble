## Characters
#### Ken
Ken is small and fast, very good at dashing around and evading attacks. His Dash does minimal damage but is the fastest in the group. His ranged attack is a quick shooting fireball out in a straight line dealing medium damage which is made up for by an insane rate of fire. Ken's melee is a powerful backflip, dealing a large amount of damage and knockback in an AOE around him.

#### Harry
Harry is a powerhouse, every attack dealing huge amounts of damage, however he lacks in speed. The amount of time it takes to build up his attacks, as well as walk speed and dash are significatly slower than any other character. His Melee attack is the heaviest hitting attack in the game, he smashes the ground in front of him shaking the arena as he hits. Harry's Ranged attack is a rock that curves through the air, dealing huge damage to anything in its way.

#### Alex
Alex is a powerful fighter, he is quite agile and his attacks are universally good. His main weapon is his stick, giving all of his attacks good range. His dash is one of his most powerful attacks, as he spins around with his stick giving a massive AOE and lots of damage. His Melee attack is a whip with his stick, giving a huge range in front of him, and his ranged attack is simply throwing his stick in an arc.
